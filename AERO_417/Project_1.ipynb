    "# General view of a gas turbine project: \n",
    "\n",
    "The design process is shown as starting from a specification, resulting from either market research or a customer requirement; the process is similar for both aero and industrial engines. There are very few customers who are powerful enough to have an engine built to their specific requirement, and the specification normally results from market research. The development of a high-performance gas turbine is extremely costly, and may be shared by several companies; in the case of aero engines this may require multinational consortia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specification is rarely a simple statement of required power and efficiency. other factors of major importance, which vary with the application, include weight, cost, volume, life and noise, and many of these criteria act in opposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first major design step is to carry out thermodynamic design point studies. These are detailed calculations taking into account all important factors such as expected component efficiencies, air-bleeds, variable fluid properties and pressure losses, and would be carried out over a range of pressure ratio and turbine inlet temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "The thermodynamic design point calculations having determined the airflow, pressure ratio and turbine inlet temperature, attention can be turned to the aerodynamic design of the turbomachinery. It is now possible to determine annulus dimensions, rotational speeds and number of stages. At this point it may well be found that difficulties arise which may cause the aerodynamicists to consult with the thermodynamic and mechanical designers to see if a change in the design point could be considered, perhaps a slight increase in turbine inlet temperature, a decrease in pressure ratio or an increase in rotational speed. The aerodynamic design of the turbomachinery must take into account manufacturing feasibility from the outset. When designing the centrifugal compressor for a small engine, for example, the space required for milling cutters between adjacent passages is of prime importance. In large turbofans, in contrast, the weight of the fan blades is dependent on the bypass ratio and the fan diameter, and the imbalance caused by the loss of a blade plays an important role in the design of the bearing support system and the structure required for fan containment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanical design can start only after the thermodynamic and aerodynamic design teams have established the key dimensions of the engine. It will then probably be found that stress or vibration problems may lead to further changes, the requirements of the stress and aerodynamics groups often being in opposition. At the same time as these studies are proceeding, off-design performance and control system design must be considered; off-design operation will include the effects of both varying ambient and flight conditions and reduced power operation. When designing a control system to ensure the safe and automatic operation of the engine, it is necessary to be able to predict parameters such as temperatures and pressure levels throughout the engine and to select some of these as control parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design of the engine must be carried out with consideration for future growth. once the engine has entered service, there will be demands from customers for more powerful or more efficient versions, leading to the development of uprated engines. Indeed, such demands may often arise before the design process has been completed, particularly for aero engines. When engines have to be uprated, the designer must consider such methods as increasing the mass flow, turbine inlet temperature and component efficiencies, while maintaining the same basic engine design. A successful engine may have its power tripled during a long development cycle. Eventually, however, the engine will become dated and no longer competitive with newer technology designs. The timing of a decision to start a new design is of critical importance for the economic well-being of the manufacturer.\n",

    "Reviewing the theory presented earlier, it is seen that there is no equation which enables the designer to select a suitable value of rotational speed. This can be found, however, by assuming values for the blade tip speed, and the axial velocity and hub-tip ratio at the inlet to the first stage. The required annulus area at entry is obtained from the specified mass flow, assumed axial velocity, and ambient conditions, using the continuity equation. previous experience will suggest that a tip speed, $U t$, of around $350 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$ will lead to acceptable stresses and that the axial velocity, Ca, could range from 150 to $200 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. Without IGVs there will be no whirl component of velocity at inlet, and this will increase the Mach number relative to the blade, so it may be advisable to use a modest value of $150 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$ for Ca .\n",
    "\n",
    "The hub-tip ratio at entry may vary between 0.4 and 0.6 , and for a specified annulus area the tip radius will be a function of the hub-tip ratio. For a fixed blade speed, then, the rotational speed will also be a function of hub-tip ratio. Thus, the designer will, in very short order, be presented with a wide range of solutions and must use engineering judgement to select the most promising. At the same time the turbine designer will be examining a suitable turbine and the compressor and turbine designers must keep in close contact while establishing preliminary designs.\n",
